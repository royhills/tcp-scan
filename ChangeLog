2022-09-18 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* check-tcp-scan-run1: Changed "$srcdir/tcp-scan" to "./tcp-scan"
	  in test scripts so "make distcheck" succeeds.

2022-09-14 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* README.md, .github/workflows/*: Migrated from travis-ci to github
	  actions for CI/CD build check and code coverage report.

	* .travis.yml: removed as no longer needed.

2013-12-01 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac, .gitignore: Added configure option --enable-gcov to
	  enable gcov code coverage.

2013-09-05 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Change the bug-report string in AC_INIT from the
	  tcp-scan email address to the github URL.

	* tcp-scan.c, check-tcp-scan-run1: updated to take account of
	  changes to bug-report string.

2013-08-16 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* .gitignore: New file listing patterns to exclude from the repository.

	* COPYING: New file.

	* Removed $Id$ keywords from all files, and associated rcsid variables
	  from C source. These are not really needed and they don't work with
	  git.

2013-08-15 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Final SVN revision before moving to git.

2013-05-02 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c: Removed unneeded errlen declaration to avoid "set but
	  not used" warning with GCC 4.6 and later.

	* check-sizes.c: Added conditional include for <limits.h>, which is
	  needed to define CHAR_BIT on Debian Wheezy.

	* configure.ac: Added check for limits.h header. Incremented version
	  number to 1.20.

2011-08-18 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.1: Added options section to manpage.

	* tcp-scan.c:  Use pcap_get_selectable_fd() rather than pcap_fileno()
          to get the pcap file descriptor. Use "stdin" instead of
	  fdopen(0,"r") when using --filename=-

2011-07-01 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Updated to latest version from arp-scan source tree.
	  This includes the GCC_WEXTRA macro and removes the dependence on the
	  <features.h> header.

	* configure.ac: Removed version number from AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE macro,
	  as this usage is obsolete now. Added -Wshadow warning switch and
	  Added GCC_WEXTRA macro to determine if the C compiler supports the
	  -Wextra switch to enable extra warnings. Define ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED
	  macro to enable portable use of attribute unused to mark possibly
	  unused function arguments.

	* tcp-scan.c, tcp-scan.h, utils.c: Remove unused variables, address
	  signed/unsigned comparisons highlighted by -Wextra and address
	  shadowed variable warnings.

2009-08-15 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c, utils.c: Improve handling of --bandwidth and
	  --interval options: Allow either upper or lowercase
	  multiplier letters and give an error if an unknown multiplier
	  character is used.  Previously an unknown multiplier character
	  or one with the wrong case was silently ignored and treated as
	  no multiplier at all.

	* wrappers.c: Change Strtoul so it gives an error if the
	  underlying strtoul function finishes at an unconvertable
	  character other than NULL or whitespace.

	* configure.ac: Added extra warning "-Wwrite-strings" for gcc.

2009-05-06 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: upgraded for autoconf 2.61

2009-03-06 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Added macros to detect compiler support for
	  -fstack-protect, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE and -Wformat-security.

	* configure.ac: Conditionally enable compiler flags for
	  -fstack-protect, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE and -Wformat-security using
	  the new acinclude.m4 autoconf macros.

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.18

2008-10-30 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* check-sizes.c: New program to check the sizes of key types and
	  structures.

2008-10-25 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c: Added new --pcapsavefile (-C) option to allow
	  received TCP packets to be saved to a pcap file for later
	  analysis.

	* configure.ac: Improved checks for pcap library.

	* Minor code changes to improve portability.

2008-10-24 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: incremented version number to 1.16.
	  First beta test version for DK, DC & AP.

	* tarball: tcp-scan-1.16.tar.gz
	  Size: 167,451 MD5: 9fa6ea49e2648cba49a94a61ccadcfbe

2008-07-11 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c: Removed reference to RMIF environment variable.
	  tcp-scan now uses the value specified with --interface, or
	  if that is not specified, picks an interface with
	  pcap_lookupdev().

2008-02-04 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c: Improved get_source_ip function: close socket descriptor
	  after use, and give better error message if the interface has no
	  IP address.

	* tcp-scan.c: Added new --port (-p) option to replace the now
	  depreciated --data (-D) option.

	* tcp-scan.c: Modified usage() so that it can output either brief or
	  detailed help output depending on a new "detailed" argument.  Now,
	  detailed output, including information on the available options, is
	  only displayed when ike-scan is run with the --help option.  For
	  error conditions such as incorrect options, it only produces brief
	  output.

	* tcp-scan.c: Added --servicefile2 (-E) option to allow the TCP service
	  filename to be specified.

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.15.

2008-02-04 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac, tcp-scan.h: Add Posix regular expression support with
	  header file regex.h.

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.14.

	* tcp-scan.c: Improved algorithm to create port name map from
	  services file.  This new algorithm uses Posix regex functions.

	* tcp-scan-services: Improved port list in services file.

2007-12-31 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c: Use mersenne twister PRNG to generate random values
	  for seq_no, ack_no and source_port rather than using an md5 hash.

	* md5.c, md5.h: Source files removed as they are no longer needed.

	* tcp-scan.h: Removed include for md5.h.

	* tcp-scan-services: New TCP services file.

	* tcp-scan.c: Use TCP service file in DATADIR rather than using hard-
	  coded absolute path.

	* tcp-scan.1: New manpage file.

2007-12-24 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Removed rawip-scan-engine.c and rawip-scan-engine.h.  Code moved to
          tcp-scan.c and definitions to tcp-scan.h

	* New source file: utils.c, containing utility functions.

	* Added mt19937ar.c: mersenne twister PRNG.
	  Changed random number implementation to use the mersenne twister
	  functions from mt19937ar.c rather than random() from the C
          library.  This improves portability, as random() is not part of
          standard C.

	* Removed unneeded --protocol (-p) option.

        * configure.ac: Added checks for strlcat and strlcpy, with
          replacement functions using the OpenBSD implementations if they are
          not present.

        * strlcat.c, strlcpy.c: New source files from the OpenBSD source at
          http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/string

	* *.c: replaced calls to strcat and strncat with strlcat, and
          calls to strcpy and strncpy with strlcpy.

	* configure.ac, tcp-scan.h: Added checks for headers sys/ioctl.h,
	  net/if.h and sys/utsname.h, and made these conditional includes.

	* tcp-scan.h, tcp-scan.c: Change structure definitions to
          typedefs.  i.e. change "struct foo {defs};" to
          typedef struct {defs} foo;".

	* tcp-scan.c: Removed unneeded Gettimeofday() call in
	  add_host_port().

	* tcp-scan.c: Change calls to strtol() to use the new
          wrapper function Strtol() instead, because this checks for
          errors.  Previously, a non-numeric value would be converted to
          zero without any error, meaning something like "--snap=xxx"
          would be silently accepted.  Now such invalid inputs results in
          an error.

2007-12-21 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Converted tcp-scan to GPL license.  Previous versions were
	  NTA Monitor internal use only.

	  Added GPL text to beginning of all source files and to
	  --version output.

	  Added files AUTHORS, ChangeLog, NEWS, README and TODO.

	  Removed unneeded files random.c, generic-ip-scan.c and
	  generic-ip-scan.h.

	  Removed variables "scanner_name" and "scanner_version" and replaced
	  with PACKAGE_STRING.

	  Removed DNS lookup for tcp-scan-target.

	  Removed syslog code.  We don't use this any more, and I doubt that
	  anyone else needs it.

	  configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.13
